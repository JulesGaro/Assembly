# Assembly

A DNA sequence Assembly algorithm made for a school exercice.

it can Assemble a list of sequence to a single one. The program will seek the 
sequence with the best alignement to the contig each time by allow an error rate of 90%.
It will try to align to the right or to the left and the potential error will be "corrected"
by replace the "wrong" nucleotide by the one of aligned sequence.
